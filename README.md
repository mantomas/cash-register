### Simple Python calculator for showing cash register difference.

Using Tkinter as a GUI. Sums all money and calculate the difference against reference value. It takes one backup value from a file and can save new value to that file - there is no database, just simple TXT files. Difference value is stored in separate file with actual date and time, and so its progress can be compared. 

## Current version is 1.2
I'm thinking about refactoring the app, as it was my first practical attempt to write some usable application. It's used daily since then.
